      Jasmine (botanical name: Jasminum; /ˈjæsmɪnəm/
    YAS-mih-nəm)is a genus of shrubs and vines in the olive
    family of Oleaceae.
    : 193  It contains around 200 species native to tropical
    and warm temperate regions of Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania.
    : 194  Jasmines are widely cultivated for the characteristic
    fragrance of their flowers.
    Additionally a number of unrelated species of plants or
    flowers contain the word "jasmine" in their common names
    (see Other plants called "jasmine").
    Jasmine can be either deciduous (leaves falling in autumn)
    or evergreen (green all year round), and can be erect,
    spreading, or climbing shrubs and vines.
    Their leaves are borne in opposing or alternating arrangement and
    can be of simple, trifoliate, or pinnate formation.
    The basic chromosome number of the genus is 13, and most 
    species are diploid (2n=26). However, natural polyploidy exists,
     particularly in Jasminum sambac (triploid 3n=39), Jasminum flexile
    (tetraploid 4n=52), Jasminum mesnyi (triploid 3n=39), and Jasminum 
    angustifolium (tetraploid 4n=52).
    Jasmines are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Eurasia,
     Africa, Australasia within Oceania, although only one of the 200
     species is native to Europe.
     Their center of diversity is in South Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>

      Tulips are spring-blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous
    geophytes in the Tulipa genus. Their flowers are usually large,
   showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow,
   or white.
  They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the 
  tepals, internally. Because of a degree of variability within
  the populations and a long history of cultivation, classification 
  has been complex and controversial.
  The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with
  14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana,
  Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.
  There are about 75 species, and these are divided among four
  subgenera. The name "tulip" is thought to be derived from a
  Persian word for turban, which it may have been thought to 
  resemble by those who discovered it.
 Tulips were originally found in a band stretching from Southern
  Europe to Central Asia, but since the seventeenth century have
   become widely naturalised and cultivated (see map).
 In their natural state, they are adapted to steppes and
  mountainous areas with temperate climates.
Flowering in the spring, they become dormant in the summer once
 the flowers and leaves die back, emerging above ground as a shoot 
 from the underground bulb in early spring.</p>

    <p id="RoseDesc">
      A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the
     genus Rosa (/ˈroʊzə/),in the family Rosaceae (/roʊˈzeɪsiːˌiː/),
     or the flower it bears.
     There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands
     of cultivars.They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs,
     climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp
     prickles.Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually
     large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows
     and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers
     native to Europe, North America, and Northwest Africa.
     Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for 
     their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired
     cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range
     in size from compact, miniature roses to climbers that can
     reach seven meters in height.
     Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used
     in the development of the wide range of garden roses.
     The flowers of most species have five petals, with the
     exception of Rosa omeiensis and Rosa sericea, which usually have
     only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and
     is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red.
     Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some Rosa 
     omeiensis and Rosa sericea, four).
     These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above
     and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals.
     There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.
     Roses are insect-pollinated in nature.</p>
